Companies like GitHub , Twitter , and Apple are actively supporting a move to inclusive language. Demo \u00b6 Why is this named woke ? \u00b6 When I started writing woke in August 2020, my goal was to build a tool that would shed light on non-inclusive language in source code and that would enable a long-term commitment to using inclusive language. woke is a reference to an awareness of social and political issues, especially racial prejudice and discrimination, and has a historic use within the African-American community. This tool aims to push this kind of awareness even further into the software development community. I named this project woke because I saw it as a tool to awaken our code to non-inclusive language.

All ways of ignoring files below should follow the gitignore convention. ignore_files : - other/files/in/repo - globs/too/* .git Woke will always ignore the .git directory so there's no need to include it in any of the ignore configurations. woke will also automatically ignore anything listed in .gitignore , .ignore , and .git/info/exclude . .wokeignore \u00b6 You may also specify a .wokeignore file at the root of the directory to add additional ignore files. This also follows the gitignore convention. See .wokeignore.example for a collection of common files and directories that may contain generated SHA and GUID s. Dependency directories are also shown in the example as the linter will parse dependency source code and possibly find errors. In-line and next-line ignoring \u00b6 There may be times where you don't want to ignore an entire file. You may ignore a specific line for one or more rules by creating an in-line or next-line comment. This functionality is very rudimentary, it does a simple search for the phrase. Since woke is just a text file analyzer, it has no concept of the comment syntax for every file type it might encounter. For in-line ignoring, simply add the following to the line you wish to ignore, using comment syntax that is supported for your file type. Danger woke is not responsible for broken code due to in-line ignoring. Make sure you comment correctly! Next-line ignoring works in a similar way. Instead of adding to the end of line you wish to ignore, you can create the ignore comment on its own line just before it. Any alphanumeric text to the left of the phrase will cause woke to treat it as an in-line ignore, but any text to the right of the phrase will not be considered. Note Next-line ignore comments takes precedence over in-line ignores, so try to only use one for any given line!

Rules can be customized to suit your needs. Provide a list file globs for files you'd like to check. woke [globs ...] [flags] Options \u00b6 -c, --config string Config file (default is .woke.yaml in current directory, or $HOME) --debug Enable debug logging --disable-default-rules Disable the default ruleset --exit-1-on-failure Exit with exit code 1 on failures -h, --help help for woke --no-ignore Ignored files in .gitignore, .ignore, .wokeignore, .git/info/exclude, and inline ignores are processed -o, --output string Output type [text,simple,github-actions,json,sonarqube,checkstyle] (default \"text\") --stdin Read from stdin Auto generated by spf13/cobra on 18-Mar-2022 \u00b6 Config file \u00b6 Configure your custom rules config in .woke.yaml or .woke.yml . woke uses the following precedence order. Each item takes precedence over the item below it: current working directory $HOME This file will be picked up automatically up your customizations without needing to supply it with the -c flag. See example.yaml for an example of adding custom rules. You can also supply your own rules with -c path/to/rules.yaml if you want to handle different rulesets. Remote config file \u00b6 You can also use a remote config file by providing a publicly-accessible URL. $ woke -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/get-woke/woke/main/example.yaml No findings found. Inputs \u00b6 File globs \u00b6 By default, woke will run against all text files in your current directory. To change this, supply a space-separated list of globs as the first argument. This can be something like **/*.go , or a space-separated list of filenames. $ woke test.txt test.txt:2:2-11: ` Blacklist ` may be insensitive, use ` denylist ` , ` blocklist ` instead ( warning ) * Blacklist ^ test.txt:3:2-12: ` White-list ` may be insensitive, use ` allowlist ` instead ( warning ) * White-list ^ test.txt:4:2-11: ` whitelist ` may be insensitive, use ` allowlist ` instead ( warning ) * whitelist ^ test.txt:5:2-11: ` blacklist ` may be insensitive, use ` denylist ` , ` blocklist ` instead ( warning ) * blacklist ^ STDIN \u00b6 You can also provide text to woke via STDIN (Standard Input) $ echo \"This has whitelist from stdin\" | woke --stdin /dev/stdin:1:9-18: ` whitelist ` may be insensitive, use ` allowlist ` instead ( warning ) This has whitelist from stdin ^ This option may not be used at the same time as File Globs Outputs \u00b6 Options for output include text (default), simple, json, github-actions, sonarqube, or checkstyle format.

Note: woke is not executed as part of SonarQube itself, so must be run and the results file output prior to execution. Typically woke would be executed with an automation server such as Jenkins, Travis CI or Github Actions prior to creating the SonarQube report. For details on the file format, see Generic Issue Input Format . The Analysis Parameter sonar.externalIssuesReportPaths is used to point to the path to the report file generated by woke . Structure \u00b6 Info Actual output from woke will be consolidated JSON.

The idea is, if you run woke on PRs, you may not want to block a merge, but you do want to inform the author that they can make better word choices. If you're using woke on PRs, you can choose to enforce these rules with a non-zero exit code by running woke --exit-1-on-failure . Parallelism \u00b6 Advanced Configuration It's unlikely that you will need to adjust parallelism. But in case you do, if you are running woke with limited resources, and/or against a very large directory, you may want to restrict the number of threads that woke uses. By default, woke will parse files in parallel and will consume as many resources as it can, unbounded. This means woke will be fast, but might run out of memory, depending on how large the files/lines are. We can limit these allocations by bounding the number of files read in parallel. To accomplish this, set the environment variable WORKER_POOL_COUNT to an integer value of the fixed number of goroutines you would like to spawn for reading files.
