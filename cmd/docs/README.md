# Autogenerated usage docs

This command is used to generate a markdown document that documents woke's usage.
It is currently used in conjunction with the GitHub action that auto-deploys the mkdocs documentation page.

See [docs/README.md](../../docs/README.md)

This command will run automatically if `cmd/**/*.go` changes. If the output of this command changes `docs/snippets/woke.md`, the change will be pushed to the main branch, which will trigger an mkdocs deploy. See [.github/workflows/update-woke-usage.yml](../../.github/workflows/update-woke-usage.yml) for details.

**You would only need to run this command if you change some CLI option for woke and want to view the change locally when running the docs site**

## Running

```bash
# running from root of repo
go run cmd/docs/main.go <output_dir>

# this command will create a file `docs/snippets/woke.md`
go run cmd/docs/main.go docs/snippets
```
