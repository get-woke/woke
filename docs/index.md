## About

Creating an inclusive work environment is imperative to a healthy, supportive, and
productive culture, and an environment where everyone feels welcome and included.

`woke` is a text file analysis tool that finds places within your source code that contain
non-inclusive language and suggests replacing them with more inclusive alternatives.

Companies like [GitHub](https://github.com/github/renaming), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TwitterEng/status/1278733303508418560), and [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=1o9zxsxl) are actively supporting a move to inclusive language.
